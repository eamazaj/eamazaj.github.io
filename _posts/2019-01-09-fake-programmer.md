1. They talk and talk about their code. But their code won’t do much talking.
2. Modular Design. They just don’t understand it. Nor about maintaining a large codebase.
3. Their comments are larger than their code.
4. NoSQL and shiny languages/frameworks are their buzzwords. But have no idea why one should or should not use them.
5. Memorizing code. I repeat. Memorizing code. Line by line. Especially for technical interviews.
6. Copy-paste code from StackOverflow without at least reading through it once.
7. Won’t get frustrated when something doesn’t work as intended. It won’t keep them up at night. Would lack that delight at finding the solution that had been staring at his/her face for so long!
8. They code and its over. They don’t want to keep polishing it later.
